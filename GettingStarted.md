## Getting started with Git and Github

So you've decided to show off your coding skillz, you've used a little git and you've heard of the popular github site. This is a small account of the steps you'll have to go through.

## Preliminaries
Of course you'll have to have git set up on your local machine. And you will indeed have to create a userid on the github site. If you're like me you'll favour ssh for communicating with remote hosts, so as soon as you have your github account, yuo'll want to paste in your public key into the appropriate section of github's account settings.

## Global configure variables in you local user

```git config --global user.name <mygithubuserid>```
```git config --global user.email <mygithubemail>```

I'm not sure if these exactly need to be based on your github identity, because the documents don't say, and I actually suspect they don't have to be, but, as usual, it's best to err on the side of caution.
