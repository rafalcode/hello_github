first tenuous steps with github

# A Generative Story
(the double lines underneath the title and the hash before a title, seem to have the same effect: to create a <H1> type title).

I'm going to slowly build up this particular file. Which means, that this file, README.md, will be:

* built-up
* slowly

Here's a **gratuitous link** (double asterisks are like triple  single-quotes in wikimarkup):
(Note the resemblance to a [finite mixture model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model).)

## Subtitle ... githubmd treatment of single newlines

It seems as if githubmd (github markdown) will ignore
single newlines like this one, but not

this double one.
